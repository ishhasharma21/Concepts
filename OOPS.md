# Object Oriented Programming 

> High level languages have a greater level of abstraction from the computer. Independent of the computer hardware architecture. Focusses more on programming logic and not underlying H/W operations.

### Procedure Oriented Programming 
A problem is viewed as a **sequence of things to be done**. Basically consists of writing instructions and organizing them into groups called *functions*.

**Features** : 
- Top Down approach 
- Divided into functions
- Functions share global data 
- Data moves around throughout program 
- Each function transforms the global data member 

**Disadvantages** : 
- No data hiding
- Cannot model real world 
- Global Data access


### Object Oriented Programming 
Believes in **modularizing** programs by creating **partitioned memory spaces** and allowing for **templates** of functions and attributes to be replicated for use whenever need arises.

**Features** :
- Bottom Up approach 
- Data is hidden, cannot be accessed by external functions
- New functions / attributes easily added
- Emphasis is on *doing* rather than procedure
- Structures and classes hold logically related components (functions / attributes)
- Program divided into objects
- Objects communicate using functions


## Basic Concepts of OOPS **
**Objects**
>Basic runtime entities in OOPS. Both functions and attributes are combined to form objects.
```
Object : Isha 
Attributes : Age = 21, Height = 160
Methods : calculateSalary()
```

**Classes**
> Group of objects. Contain member methods and attributes. 
 
**Abstraction**
> Reveal only essential features and conceal things not needed by the user. Data binding and data hiding.

**Encapsulation**
> Wrapping of methods & attributes into a class / structure. Data isn't accessible to the outside world

**Inheritance**
> Class components acquire properties of other classes. Provides reusability. Can add new features without modifying existing ones. 

**Polymorphism**
> Runtime (Overriding) & Compile time (Overloading)

**Dynamic Binding**
> research and put

**Message Passing**
> research and put

In a normal C++ program 
```
#include<iostrem> : preprocessor directive telling compiler to include these header files*
using namespace std : all elements of C++ are linked with standard namespace. So declare it once else we'll have to keep using scope resolution operator
int main() : execution starts here 
return () : signals the end of function
```

**TOKENS**
- Keywords (reserved words)
- Identifiers (variable / method names)
- String 
- Constants
- Operators
