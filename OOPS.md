# Object Oriented Programming 

> High level languages have a greater level of abstraction from the computer. Independent of the computer hardware architecture. Focusses more on programming logic and not underlying H/W operations.

### Procedure Oriented Programming 
A problem is viewed as a **sequence of things to be done**. Basically consists of writing instructions and organizing them into groups called *functions*.
Features : 
- Top Down approach 
- Divided into functions
- Functions share global data 
- Data moves around throughout program 
- Each function transforms the global data member 

Disadvatnages : 
- No data hiding
- Cannot model real world 
- Global Data access
